# WebSockets Avalon Helper
This is just a simple (pretty buggy) WebSocket-based helper for playing Avalon remotely.
It takes care of things that would be difficult to impossible to handle without being physically present and/or using cards.
However, it doesn't track a lot of different things:
- Which quest the game is on/how many people go on that quest.
- Voting for whether or not a proposed quest is accepted.
- The Lady of the Lake.
- Many other things.
